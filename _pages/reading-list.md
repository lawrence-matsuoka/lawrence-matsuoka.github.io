The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt: Pragmatic as the title says. Some "common knowledge" and some new stuff. 

[Codin' Dirty](https://htmx.org/essays/codin-dirty/) by Carson Gross: A short essay that go against the "Clean Code" approach.

The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation by Jon Gertner:

Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell:
