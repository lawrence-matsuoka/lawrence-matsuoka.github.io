BSc in Mathematics, minor in Business from Dalhousie University

I like number theory and cryptography. I don't like calculus or analysis.

My favourite programming languages to use tend to be lower-level, mostly in C, some C++, and learning more and more Assembly (x86 and MSP430, but will expand to other architectures like ARM and RISC-V later).

I like free and open-source software. Linux enthusiast _sips tea_. I also enjoy learning about how to improve my own privacy and security so I can own my data through efforts like DeGoogling.

I dabble in game development as a creative outlet and maybe to make a living one day? Currently working on a horror game using the Godot game engine with friends under Mastodon Studios.
