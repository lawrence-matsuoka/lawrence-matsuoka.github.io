# Hello, World!... or Blinky?

This is my first blog post that will serve many purposes, both technically and personally. I aim to primarily use this blog to keep a track record of what I have learned and accomplished technically. I think writing it will serve as a useful way of better learning how to communicate more technical concepts. On a personal level, I think it might be interesting to break some technical posts up with more "random" ideas, such as books I'm reading, how my weightlifting training is going, or some other miscellaneous thoughts I have. 

For some background, I am about to complete my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Business. I have lots of fun learning and solving problem in pure math (fields like number theory, combinatorial game theory, or discrete mathematics). 

## Booting up

I have always loved putting things together. When I was a kid, I built lego and model kits obsessively. Never because I enjoyed looking at them or having them, but because the process of piecing them together was all I cared about. This naturally transitioned into the first time I had my own computer when I was 12 years old, a PC where I chose all the individual parts. My dad and I stayed up until 2AM the night all the parts arrived and I used this PC until I was 21 and moved out of my parents' home into an apartment. 

During those 9 years I should have realized earlier that technology was an area I should study and actually work in, instead of dedicating my life to gaming. My parents had an expectation that I would go straight into university from high school and when looking back it would be obvious that I hadn't had much foresight at all. I decided to apply and pursue a Bachelor of Commerce because I wasn't too sure what to do, and because my brother had by this time established a very successful career in finance on Bay Street, Toronto. It took me 2.5 years pursuing a degree in accounting to realize that maybe this wasn't quite the right field for me. The most useful thing to come out of my business degree was landing several internships and working for David at his startup. I came in as a business student and left as a statistics student (which did not stick for very long before I made the pivot into mathematics). Working made me realize that what I enjoyed most from business was the "technical" aspects. Things like using Excel and PowerPoint, while I dreaded and still dread networking and making connections. This isn't about meeting new people but it's the feeling of making surface-level and transactional relationships that I really do not like, but that's a whole other can of worms. 

## Loading...

Basically to sum up, all of my past experience has made me who I am today and have led me to my current interests. Enough about me and onto the actual goals of the block now. Primarily, I want to document my exploration of more subjects in mathematics and computers, whether software or hardware.

### Mathematics

I want to improve my calculus and take real analysis a bit more seriously. I think I also should brush up on my linear algebra since it seems to be one of the most applicable fields of mathematics for programming. This is also to lay a solid foundation for diving into abstract algebra, which I wish I had taken classes in since the very brief topics we touched on in my cryptography class were very interesting. And speaking about cryptography, that class is easily my favourite "applied" math course I took throughout my degree. I care about security and privacy which is why I self-host many services, and also am interested in careers in security whether it be more of the security research route of the cryptography route. 

### Lower level programming

I won't claim that I am a "good" C programmer, but I will say that in terms of programming languages, C has proven to be my one true love. I will always think that writing code in C is both fun and understandable. Because the capabilities of the language are so simple and there is very little abstraction, everything seems so clear while writing C. Of course, it's difficult to write C safely and I'm sure I make many mistakes but throughout the process I always have fun with it. I wrote a bit of C++, mostly when making the game [HexFML](), and I can see the appeal but the language seems like such a mess to me in so many ways. I will start using C++ more, since I know it is quite an employable language (and for me more enjoyable than many others). 

Assembly is something I've chipped away at for a while but can never get too invested in since there are basically no jobs that care if you can write Assembly. I have written simple programs on an MSP430 though and also wrote a bootable OS that prints out "Hello World" in x86 Assembly using NASM and QEMU. I want to eventually write a fully fledged operating system to automate the future garden and home that my girlfriend and I want to own in the future. If you have ever played Stardew Valley, the inspiration is the farm computer item from that game. 

## Buffering

My separate career decisions and what I'm doing:
software dev: algorithms, pragmatic programmer, go in on C++ and read [A Tour of C++]() from the man himself
embedded: low level and fun hardware things like soldering and microcontrollers and circuits, need more projects under my belt to demonstrate my capabilities
cryptography: applied cryptography by bruce schneier and learning go with cryptopals, security engineer route or really cryptocurrencies.
IT route with cybersecurity and reverse engineer/threat intelligence/malware analyst/security researcher. I have set up my own home lab consisting

I want to also document my current career goals since I am at a confusing and interesting point where I could see myself pursuing various different paths. I enjoy OSDev and cryptography, but I see these two as less employable. I would either need to find very niche opportunities or pursue graduate-level education, which is what I'd like to avoid for now. Realistically, I want to get experience as either a software developer, embedded systems/firmware developer, or as a malware analyst. These job titles seem to have the most overlap with my interests. Some of the first posts here will most likely be about exercises I work through while reading the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski, and I am trying to gain some hands on experience so I can hopefully land a job in the malware/threat intel/securisy research domain. 

Another possibility in the distant future may be in game development. I am currently working on a project with my girlfriend and our friend where we are planning on making a horror game in Godot. I have a bit of experience with gamedev in the aforementioned HexFML, and this could definitely be an interesting and satisfying career path if I'm able to develop closer to the hardware.

## Going to sleep

I appreciate anyone who has read through this post. I hope to have a somewhat regular posting schedule in the future and accomplish lots of learning during this time.
