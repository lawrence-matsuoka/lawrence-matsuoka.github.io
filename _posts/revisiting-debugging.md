title: "Revisiting my Stance on Debugging"

#

I previously talked about how when debugging I mostly just print stuff and don't see much of a purpose in debuggers.
This clip from The Standup [](https://youtu.be/M2ZW4uwxU8k?si=QdwGYxIGCblxPqqb&t=1342) in which Casey Muratori says that one of the main reasons he can never switch from Windows to Linux for development is because of the debuggers. Radde debugger and even Visual Studio. I will try Radde debugger when it becomes available for Linux, but for now I want to try using gdb.
